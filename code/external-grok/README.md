# Unifying Grokking and Double Descent
Xander Davies, Lauro Langosco, and David Krueger

This is the repository for "Unifying Grokking and Double Descent," appearing at the [2022 NeurIPS ML Safety Workshop](https://neurips2022.mlsafety.org/).

See `toy_model.ipynb` for the toy model results, and `grok-replication/` for code replicating grokking (which can be used to replicate model-wise grokking).
